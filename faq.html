                                            <p>Here at Buddy Loans we obviously think that our Guarantor loans are the best 
                                            thing since sliced bread, but you might not have heard of such a thing before, 
                                            so here's a few reasons why we think they are so good!</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>As the high street and mainstream banks have tightened up their lending criteria 
                                                over the last few years, many people can struggle to get the credit they need at an affordable rate.</li>
                                                <li>Had a problem with managing your finances in the past? This can definitely be a 
                                                big no-no for mainstream lenders and our experience is that they are very reluctant 
                                                to give any sort of credit to someone with missed payments, arrears, defaults etc. 
                                                on their credit file. With this in mind, if you have the affordability to pay your 
                                                loan then getting someone who has a good credit history to support your application 
                                                means that you can potentially obtain the credit you need from Buddy Loans!</li>
                                                <li>Haven't had any credit before? If you are unproven in the credit market, 
                                                then getting credit can sometimes be a real struggle. Again, if you can find 
                                                yourself a suitable guarantor who is willing to help you out then potentially 
                                                we can help you out in getting the loan you need</li>
                                                <li>We can offer you flexible repayment dates throughout the month which best suit you 
                                                to ensure your repayments are made at the right time</li>
                                                <li>Our application process isn't that typical automated "computer says yes or no"!...  
                                                You will speak with one of our team who will go through the whole process with you to 
                                                ensure that your loan is best suited to you and that most importantly its affordable 
                                                to both you and your guarantor.</li>
                                                <li> We can process your loan quickly... Our online application process coupled 
                                                with the discussions you will have with our team mean that we can typically get 
                                                your loan agreed within the same day if everything is in order. This means we 
                                                can get the money you need to you in a timely fashion.</li>

                                            ultimately we will pursue both you and your guarantor for any outstanding 
                                            monies and it may result in your credit ratings being affected and potential

                                            bank and high street lenders; our annual interest rate is 41.16% which works 
                                            out to 3.43% per month.</p><p> We do work out our interest on a daily basis so if 
                                            you ever want to pay off any higher amounts from your loan then it will cost 
                                            you less in the long run. You can make a payment to us without charge or
